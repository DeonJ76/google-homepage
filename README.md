For my first TOP project I will deconstruct a webpage and then rebuild it in order to practice and develop my HTML & CSS skills.

Update: 19 July 2020

My page actually looks like a google page! Who would've thought?!
I've really enjoyed the experience and I'm really looking forward to learning more. I have already experienced the well-documented phenomenon that every coder has to experience at some point in time....it works, but I'm not sure how or why?
